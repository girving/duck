h1. Templates

* Templates are the argument type annotation "opposite" of Delayed, meaning they must be given values at compile time.
* Does a template type imply that the next arrow always happens at compile time?  It seems that it must.
* How do templates relate to things like array sizes?  Is a fixed-size array one with a templated size field, or is Array parameterized over the type of the length, which could be a templated int?  Do you have to write two versions of indexing, one where the bounds check can be templatized?  (What is the right verb form of template?)

h2. Syntax

Current idea:
<pre><code>
printf :: Template String -> a
printf ('%':s) = ?
</code><code>
ntuple :: Template Int -> a
ntuple 0 = ()
ntuple 1 = ?
ntuple 2 = (,)
...
</pre></code>
